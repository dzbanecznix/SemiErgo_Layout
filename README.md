A proposal of ergonomic key layout for standard size keyboard but i made some changes

Here's how it looks like: ![without extra key]

I made altgr under right thumb because it's an important key on many layouts.

There's also a version with an extra key that makes the keys i, j, k and l work like arrow keys.
