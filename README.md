# My version
A proposal of ergonomic key layout for standard size keyboard but i made some changes

Here's how it looks like: ![without extra key](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60468598/134019036-a14bf22e-34d6-4030-ac1b-40fdc7b72a71.png)
I made altgr under right thumb because it's an important key on many layouts.

There's also a version with an extra key that makes the keys i, j, k and l work like arrow keys.
